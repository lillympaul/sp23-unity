# dude legend of zelda twilight princess is literally so good it's not even funny

## why twilight princess?
it feels like such a cop out to say this, but it's the first video game i remember completing. i watched my brother play through it when we first got it, incredibly excited as i watched what were the *coolest* graphics at the time, what seemed like the biggest open world i'd seen (given that my experience before this was limited to pok√©mon ruby and sapphire on the gameboy), and nearly endless possibilities of bug collecting and also beating up shadow monsters. the perfect balance, in my opinion then, and also my opinion now. 

i went back and played through it last summer, and i think my completion time on the file was somewhere over 50 hours because i went through and did the whole thing from start to absolute finish, doing every possible side quest to 100% completion of the game. even now, i still love the story, the gameplay, how easy the mechanics were to understand as a 7 year old and how easily i picked them back up, how much fun it was just riding around on epona, beating up enemies in hyrule field. i know nostalgia plays a big role in tp being my favorite game, but it's more than good enough to stand on its own (as proven by my sibling who both watched me play it through last summer and did a play through of their own after because they hadn't done so as a kid and wanted to now after just seeing a bit of it.)

## development company
[nintendo entertainment (analysis & development)](https://www.nintendo.com/)

## release date
nov 19, 2006 was the initial release, but i didn't play it for the first time until closer to 2010 when we got our first household console (a nintendo wii)

## game engine
twilight princess was built on a modified wind waker engine, which was custom built for ww at the time. this made development easier, but it made the hd re-release a pain in the ass, apparently, because the graphics and textures could be pretty easily updated, but the polygons and build of the game itself couldn't, and it made for some pretty wonky looking stuff in the process.
